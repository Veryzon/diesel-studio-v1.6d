Diesel Studio 1.6 (PC-Win32)

This is the version 1.6d of the Diesel Studio, the audio authoring tool for Diesel Power 3D Sound Engine.

The Diesel Studio is a 3D audio editor used to render positional 3D audio by creating a 3 dimensional environment using a receiver/listener together with sound sources. 

With the Diesel Studio user interface, it is possible to simultaneously position the receiver, and a high number of sound sources in the 3D environment. 

Each sound source is related to a wave file and can be manipulated in the 3D environment using the mouse, or along a user defined line path or circle path. 

All parameters for achieving Positional Audio are included, i.e. volume, distance attenuation, source radiation and pitch.  The playback system of Diesel Studio contains both headphone and loudspeaker playback
