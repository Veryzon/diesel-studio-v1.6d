                  <p><b>A series of sound scenarios or scenes are included in 
                    Diesel Studio. </b>These scenes illustrate the different ways 
                    in which 3-D sound operates in practice. Of course, as a user 
                    of Diesel Studio, you can, besides just listening to the scenes, 
                    also make changes in them and add new files. Before you begin 
                    to create scenes yourself with Diesel Studio you ought to 
                    experience some of those, which are included. They are constructed 
                    so that you can hear the various sound features Diesel Studio 
                    can offer.</p>
                  <p><b>Circle of numbers<br>
                    </b><span lang="EN-GB">Hear how the numbers 1-16 are placed 
                  at different locations around you at intervals of 22.5 
                  degrees.</span></p>
                  <p><b>City Walk<br>
                    </b><span lang="EN-GB">A simple scenario where you walk 
                  around in a city. You hear a woman with high-heels walking 
                  towards you. </span> 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Traffic</b><br>
                  <span lang="EN-GB">This is a complex scene created by using 
                  just two, short sound fragments. Diesel Studio offers the 
                  possibility of setting a series of parameters, which will give 
                  a dynamic expression to otherwise simple, short sounds. You 
                  are standing at a cross-roads and cars are driving past you in 
                  all directions.<br>
                  If you wish, you can add more cars to 
                  the scene, thereby creating even more complexity. </span>
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Meeting Environment </b><br>
                  <span lang="EN-GB">Virtual Meeting 
                  Environment is a system where binaural sound is used to 
                  improve communication conditions.<br><br>
                  In this example the 
                  system is implemented to improve the comprehension of four 
                  independent speakers. In the first 6 seconds the voices are 
                  placed in mono. Subsequently, they are quickly placed in the 
                  room in front of the listener.<br><br>
                  At the start it will 
                  be difficult to separate the voices in order to understand 
                  them but after they have been placed individually, it becomes 
                  possible to focus on a single sound source. <br><br>
                  It is possible to 
                  separate 2 sound sources with traditional stereo, while with 
                  binaural technology 4 - 6 sound sources can be separated. The 
                  advantages of binaural technology, in connection with 
                  telephonic conference systems, are obvious.</span></p>
                  <p><b>Pink Floyd Style</b><br>
                  <span lang="EN-GB">Binaural technology 
                  has been used in music recordings for many years. This has 
                  been done by using a technique called &quot;artificial head 
                  recording&quot;, where the listener has been placed at a certain 
                  location, for example in a symphony orchestra.<br>
                  With interactive 3-D 
                  Audio it is possible to create a totally different music 
                  experience, where not only the listener is positioned, but 
                  also where the music experience itself can change character.<br><br>
                  The Pink Floyd Style is a classic psychedelic rock-ballad. 
                  Beside the openness in the soundscape the smooth change in 
                  position gives new and surprising figures in the music 
                  experience.</span></p>
                  <p><b>Rio </b><br>
                    <span lang="EN-GB">When you hear the 
                  different rhythm instruments, you will experience the feeling 
                  of dancing in the streets of Rio de Janeiro.</span></p>
                  
                  <p><b>Weird Dream</b><br>
                  <span lang="EN-GB">Placed in a weird 
                  world with sounds all around you. In this scenario different 
                  sound – e.g. a barking dog - is used as music instruments. The 
                  exact position of the sound sources gives a high resolution of 
                  the soundscape.</span></p>

                  <p><b>The Big Blue<br></b>
                  <span lang="EN-GB">Somewhere deep in an 
                  ocean, or just above the water, you are in a large space 
                  surrounded by humpback whales and water dripping just next to 
                  you. In The Big Blue scenario you will experience the huge 
                  openness of the audio provided by Diesel Power </span>
